        Its ya boy Jonathan here age ???, first of his name, 
eldest of three siblings, caretaker of all,and overachiever 
of anything I'm interested in. Now that the introductions 
are done I came up with the idea for this website during the 
All Star Code summer intensive. This wasn't the original idea, 
but when it came to me after a group  project if felt I had to 
make it. Anyway this isn't about me UPLINK was made to help 
freshmen or other students at colleges (or highschool doesn't 
really matter) who want to find clubs they may be interested 
in. So in the end I basically made a site that would help 
students find groupdthat they share an interest in and when 
they find said group would send them to a chatroom for that club.
